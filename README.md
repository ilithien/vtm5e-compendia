# Installation

## Using a Compenidum Importer module

You can use this module to import JSON compendia directly. To access the different packs of this compendia grab one of the JSON files from the `packs` folder (i.e use `disciplines.json` if you want the disciplines. Grab all of them if you want the whole compendium). Once this module has been loaded into your world you can use those jsons as is. 

## Using the VTM5e-compendia import as independent module

You can also go to https://github.com/ilithien/vtm5e-compendia/releases an copy the url of the `module.json` of the latest release and import it as FoundryVTT module. Bear in mind that this has the limitations of the old `.db` importer. This means that right now the disciplines are not grouped into a parent folder and it might be a bit messy so, unless you donÂ´t really care about the import mess of having all the disciplines around, use the first option to import the module.
